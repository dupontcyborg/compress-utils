# compression-utils

`compression-utils` aims to simplify data compression by offering a unified interface across various algorithms and languages, while maintaining best-in-class performance. 

## Features

- [2+ built-in data compression algorithms](#built-in-compression-algorithms)
- [2+ languages supported](#supported-languages)
- [Standardized API](#usage) across all algorithms & languages
- Portable & cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, WASM)
- Prebuilt binaries available on [major package managers](#supported-languages) or can be [built from source](#build-from-source)
- Native or near-native [compression & decompression performance](#Benchmarks)
- Lightweight binary (30 kB with single algorithm, 4 MB with all)
